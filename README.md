## Background

WHO has outlined key actions for managing pandemics; testing, tracking, tracing, isolation and
quarantine. Governments around the world are applying these key actions to cope with the spread of
disease but appear to be inadequate with the scale of the outbreak. We as individuals can play a
substantial role in combating this outbreak. With the help of modern technologies, we can realise
these actions effectively.

Developing a tool targeted for government, authorities, communities, and individuals are all
acceptable. 

## Goal

Build web-based or mobile apps to help nations cope with the outbreak.

1. Identify worrying trends by applying AI and Big Data techniques to publicly available datasets.
2. Propose and develop a prototype that helps nations alleviate these worrying trends.
3. Showcase your proposal and prototype.
